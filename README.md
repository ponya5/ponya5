## 🧑‍🚀 About Me

I’m Daniel Shalom, a passionate QA & Release Engineering Leader and one of the key drivers of AI transformation at Securitize.  
With 15+ years delivering large-scale software systems, I’ve become obsessed (in the best way 😎) with:

- Designing bulletproof release pipelines
- Building multi-agent AI systems that collaborate like real engineering teams
- Creating tools that make developers superhuman
- Driving AI adoption across real organizations
- Turning chaos into structure — and structure into automation

---

## 🚀 What I Do Best

- Leading QA & Delivery for large-scale global engineering teams
- Building AI automation pipelines that save hours every day
- Architecting multi-agent systems (CrewAI, LangGraph, autonomous workflows)
- Designing full-stack AI apps (FastAPI + React)
- Turning ideas → prototypes → working products FAST
- Training teams to use AI safely and effectively

---

## 🧠 Philosophy

I believe AI is not “a tool” — it’s a productivity multiplier, a creativity amplifier, and a new layer of abstraction for building software.

**My mission:**  
Empower every team to work like they have 10× more time and 10× more ability.
